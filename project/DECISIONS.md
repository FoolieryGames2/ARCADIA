# ARCADIA Decision Log

Append decisions. Keep prior entries intact; supersede them explicitly.

## D-0001 — Workspace authority boundary

- Date: 2026-08-29
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Keep the delivered v0.1 prototype bundle unchanged as canonical design authority. Use the workspace root for live implementation and operating records.
- Reason: This preserves the validated checkpoint while allowing implementation state to evolve visibly.

## D-0002 — Implementation root

- Date: 2026-08-29
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Place Python implementation under `src/arcadia/` and tests under `tests/`.
- Reason: A conventional package boundary supports deterministic testing and prevents working code from being mixed into the frozen documentation bundle.
